# {{< fa solid flag-checkered >}} Conclusions

This **crash course** introduced several key concepts in process technology modeling and simulation using **Python**:

- **Python foundations**  
  Basic syntax, NumPy arrays, and SciPy tools for scientific computing.

- **Solving ODEs**  
  Setting up and integrating process models with `solve_ivp`.

- **Parameter estimation**  
  Fitting dynamic models to experimental data using `least_squares`.
