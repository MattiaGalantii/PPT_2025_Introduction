# Python Crash Course for Practicum Process Technology (PPT 2025)

This repository contains the slides and teaching material for the **“Introduction to Python Scientific Programming”** crash course, given as part of the **Practicum Process Technology** at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e).

The material is built with **Quarto** and **reveal.js** and is designed to be used together with a set of **Jupyter notebooks** that students run during and after the lecture.

## Contents

### 1. Slides (Quarto / reveal.js)

The main slide deck is defined in:

- `index.qmd`  
  - Title: *Practicum Process Technology – Introduction to Python Scientific Programming*  
  - Includes the following sections (as separate partial files):
    - `_intro.qmd` – course introduction, motivation, logistics  
    - `_native_python_recap.qmd` – recap of native Python: data structures, control flow, functions, OOP  
    - `_numpy_matplotlib.qmd` – essential scientific libraries: NumPy and Matplotlib  
    - `_odes_intro.qmd` – conceptual introduction to dynamical systems and ODEs  
    - `_solving_odes_intro.qmd` – linear vs nonlinear ODEs, phase space, intuition about derivatives  
    - `_solve_ivp_1.qmd` – introduction to `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` with a logistic growth (rabbit population) example  
    - `_solve_ivp_2.qmd` – solving systems of ODEs (Lorenz system, chaos and sensitivity to initial conditions)  
    - `_model_fitting.qmd` – introduction to model fitting and parameter estimation (`least_squares`)  
    - `_curve_fit.qmd` – focused example using `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`  
    - `_conclusions.qmd` – recap and links to extra material  

Configuration for the slide deck and the website lives in:

- `_quarto.yml`  
  - Project type: `website` (output in the `docs/` folder, suitable for GitHub Pages)  
  - Format: `revealjs` (16:9 slides, TU/e logo via `assets/TUe_logo.png`)  
  - Custom CSS: `styles.css`  
  - Uses a Quarto extension (`_extensions/quarto-ext`) for additional reveal.js functionality (e.g. pointer plugin).

Slide styling:

- `styles.css`  
  - Adjusts the slide logo size  
  - Defines helper classes for colored text (e.g. `.py-green`, `.numpy`, `.mpl`).

The rendered HTML version of the slides is stored in:

- `docs/`  
  - Auto-generated by `quarto render` (do **not** edit manually).  
  - Can be used directly with GitHub Pages.

### 2. Jupyter notebooks

The repository provides notebooks for **live coding during the lecture** and **additional practice**.

#### 2.1 Lecture notebooks

Stored under:

- `lecture_exercises_students/`

These notebooks are referenced from the slides, e.g.:

- `population_balance_students.ipynb`  
  - Used in `_solve_ivp_1.qmd`  
  - Demonstrates setting up and integrating ODEs with `solve_ivp` on a population balance / logistic growth problem.

- `Lorentz_system_students.ipynb` (linked as `Lorenz_system_students` in the slides)  
  - Used in `_solve_ivp_2.qmd`  
  - Implements the Lorenz system and illustrates chaos and sensitivity to initial conditions.

- `model_fitting_students.ipynb`  
  - Used in `_model_fitting.qmd` and `_curve_fit.qmd`  
  - Shows how to fit a damped sine model to noisy data using `least_squares` and `curve_fit`.

> These notebooks are intended to be opened and run by students during the crash course.

#### 2.2 Extra material & homework

Stored under:

- `extra_material/`

Referenced from `_conclusions.qmd`:

- `tutorial1.ipynb` – Python basics tutorial I  
- `tutorial2.ipynb` – Python basics tutorial II  
- `homework1.ipynb` – Homework set I  
- `homework2.ipynb` – Homework set II  
- `extra_exercises.ipynb` – Additional practice notebooks

These are meant for self-study and homework after the main session.

#### 2.3 Other notebooks

- `notebooks/`  
  - Contains additional notebooks (e.g. instructor versions, scratch work, or extended examples).  
  - Exact contents may change over time; treat this as a sandbox / extended examples area.
