## What will we do in this crash course?

In this crash course, we will cover the following topics:

>- Quick refresh about Python and scientific libraries (10-15 minutes)
- Modeling of dynamic systems, ODEs and Python implementations (45 minutes)
- Fitting models to data and parameter estimation (30 minutes)
- Hands-on exercises and real-world examples 

. . . 

By the end of this course, you will have a solid foundation in Python programming for scientific applications, enabling you to tackle the challenges you'll find in the rest of the Practicum Process Technology course.

## Why Python?
Python is a versatile and powerful programming language widely used in scientific computing and data analysis. Here are some reasons why Python is an excellent choice:

>
- **Ease of Learning:** Python has a simple and readable syntax, making it accessible for beginners.
- **Extensive Libraries:** Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib that facilitate scientific computing and data visualization.
- **Community Support:** Python has a large and active community, providing ample resources, tutorials, and forums for learning and troubleshooting.
- **It's Free 😎:** Python is open-source and free to use, making it accessible to everyone.

::: aside
Formerly, the faculty would endorse Matlab as a scripting language, but proficiency in Python is believed to be more valuable for trained engineers.

## How to program in Python?
In this course, we will primarily use Jupyter Notebooks for coding and exercises. Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive environment that allows you to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document. 

. . . 

You can run Jupyter Notebooks locally on your computer using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or use cloud-based platforms such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

> Follow the instructions provided in the course materials to set up your Python environment and get started with Jupyter Notebooks.

# Any problems?
Given the time limitations, I won't address python installation and setup questions during the session. Following the setup instructions provided in the course materials is mandatory. Feel free to ask after class.
